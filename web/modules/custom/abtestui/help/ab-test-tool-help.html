        <p>
            In order to do AB Testing you can set multiple URLs (variations) and these URL-s will be rotated on one "Base URL".
            These URLs must be internal and can be eg. nodes, listers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words, if a user visits the base URL, they will be redirected to a variation, or they'll stay
            on the base URL, depending on the odds set in the test.
